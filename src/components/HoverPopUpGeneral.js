              hypothesised to be orbiting within the habitable zone of the star

              Whether they actually contain liquid water is a function of
              numerous properties of the planets including whether they have an
              atmosphere. There is no clear evidence that any of the planets has
              an atmosphere and it is unclear whether planets could retain an
              atmosphere given TRAPPIST-1's radiation emission.

                first year observing exoplanets, and 8.2% of this time studying
                TRAPPIST-1. Its infrared cameras will give us a better
